# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It felt good in a sence that it was challenging and fun to find the problems and fix them.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? I think it is going well. I sometimes zone out and fix something then go back and change it to what it was while trying to fix something else, I just take a break when i find myself doing that.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?I learned that the order of opperation is important and sometimes that something is just in the wrong spot but the code is right.
